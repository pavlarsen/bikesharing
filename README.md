# Bike Sharing in Des Moines


## Overview of Project

### For this project, I was hired to analyze a business opportunity by providing a Bike Sharing Service in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to evaluate this idea, I based our findings with an analysis over current service provided in New York City by Citibike (a bike sharing service for either annual subscribers or occasional users). The idea of this analysis is to evaluate a potential business idea for Des Moines, get to know more about the average user of Citibike in NYC and how it correlates with potential users in Des Moines. I use Tableau Desktop to present the data results and the link to the dashboard is available here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/juan.pablo.larsen/viz/Challenge_16738127926110/BikeRideIowa?publish=yes)

## Analysis Results

Key findings summary:

This Tableau story has the purpose to expose the data gathered by Citibike in NYC and explore potential similarities with current market in Des Moines

For this analysis, the scope was to analyze the busiest month during 2019: August. As NYC summer could mean more movement from tourists. As we can see on the information from this month, the Citibike service had a total of over 2.3 million rides just in 1 month. By renting a bike, it is one of the best ways to get to know a city and explore new places.

The next visualization shows where the initial trip from the users starts. As we appreciate, the darker the circle and the bigger, represents busiest starting points witch matches top touristic places.

This visualization shows us a Heatmap where the darkest zones represent the busiest times during the day and per weekday. As seen, weekends tend to be busier during most of the day, while during the working week, the service is usually implemented to ride to work and back home.

The normal ride per user usually lasts less than 40 minutes. Being 15 minutes the most normal ride length. This helps us understand and evaluate where to place the bike stops, how many bikes to have, and how far should the stops be placed in Des Moines.

Who is the typical user of this service? almost 7 users out of 10 will be males and 3 out of 10 females. This information could help for potential marketing campaigns aimed to catch the attention of our potential users in Iowa. As well as to understand if any it would be important to place special features in the bikes for better experience.

There are 2 types of users of Citibike: Customers (occasional users) and Subscriber (users with an annual plan). Most male users tend to be subscribers, and practically use the service every day. While we can adjust this service to bring more tourists to Des Moines, the base local users of potential subscribers will also be interesting for Downtown.

The next Heatmap shows us by gender the busiest time during the day where the bike sharing service is used. This helps us to identify at what time we will need more bikes, when to perform maintenance.

Finally, this last visualization represents the average ride length by gender, for both, most of the rideâ€™s length less than 20 minutes. Which means, short distances are the most traveled.

## Summary

- This initial exploration of the idea of having a bike sharing service in Des Moines, helps us understand more about the actual business in New York. The next step will be to gather information of Des Moines and understand more about local people, how many tourists visit the city, is there any other current competitor there, how local people transport from different places of the city. In terms of data analysis, the information provided by Citibike helps us identify several angles for evaluation of the opportunity such as: determining number of bikes to have, what is the length of the average ride, where are the stops located and which ones are the most popular, frame the potential user.

- Beyond the exposed visualizations presented previously, I would recommend analyzing location of warehouse / maintenance shops and if they are located near busiest places, this will enhance the time it takes to repair bikes.

- Further, once we have Des Moines demographic data, I would suggest run several analyses as well for interesting places in Des Moines, office areas, geographical and weather comparison vs NYC.
