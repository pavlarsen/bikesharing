# Bike Sharing in Des Moines


## Overview of Project

### For this project, I was hired to analize a business opportunity by providing a Bike Sharing Service in Des Moines, Iowa. In order to evaluate this idea, I based our findings with an analysis over current service provided in New York City by Citibike (a bike sharing service for either annual subsribers or occasional users). The idea of this analysis is to evaluate a potential business idea for Des Moines, get to know more about the average user of Citibike in NYC and how it correlates with potential users in Des Moines. I use Tableau Desktop to present the data results and the link to the dashboard is available here: [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/juan.pablo.larsen/viz/Challenge_16738127926110/BikeRideIowa?publish=yes)

## Analysis Results

Key findings summary:

This Tableau story has the purpose to expose the data gathered by Citibike in NYC and explore potential similarities with current market in Des Moines

For this analysis, the scope was to analyize the bussiest month during 2019: August. As NYC summer could mean more movement from tourists. As we can see on the information from this particular month, the Citibike service had a total of over 2.3 million rides just in 1 month. By renting a bike, it is one of the best ways to get to know a city and explore new places.

The next visualization shows where the initial trip from the users start. As we appreciate, the darker the circle and the bigger, represents bussiest starting points witch matches top touristic places.

This visualization shows us a Heatmap where the darkest zones represent the bussiest times during the day and per weekday. As seen, weekends tend to be bussier during most of the day, while during the working week, the service is usually implmented to ride to work and back home.

The normal ride per user usually lasts less than 40 minutues. Being 15 minutes the most normal ride lenght. This helps us understand and evaluate where to place the bike stops, how many bikes to have, and how far should the stops be placed in Des Moines.

Who is the typical user of this service? almost 7 users out of 10 will be males and 3 out of 10 females. This information could help for potential marketing campaings aimed to catch the attention of our potential users in Iowa. As well as to understand if any it would be important to place special features in the bikes for better experience.

There are 2 types of users of Citibike: Customers (occational users) and Subscriber (users with an annual plan). Most male users tend to be subscribers, and practically use the service everyday. While we can adjust this service to bring more tourists to Des Moines, the base local users of potential subscribers will also be interesting for Downtown.

The next Heatmap shows us by gender the busiest time during the day where the bike sharing service is used. This helps us to identify at what time we will need more bikes, when to perform maintenance.

Finally, this last visualization represents the average ride lenght by gender, for both, mosth of the rides lenght less than 20 minutes. Which means, short distances are the most traveled.
